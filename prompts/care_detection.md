* Be concise and clinically relevant.
* Do not invent data not present in notes.
* If unknown or missing, use `"not_documented"` or `null` for string values.
* If nothing is due, return:

  ```json
  "appointment_needed": false,
  "call_brief": null
  ```
* The `call_brief` field must be a string containing the full brief as shown in the example, or `null`.
* The `patient_id` should be extracted from the input JSON.
