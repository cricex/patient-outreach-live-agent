Doe  \nAge: 59 y.o.  \nMedical record number: 0001024407  \nPrimary provider: Olivia Davis, PA  \nReason for visit: Follow-up for non-small cell lung cancer T4N3M1a (IVA). Completed treatment with carbo/taxol/keytruda x6 cycles on 2020-09-24. Currently on treatment with Keytruda alone.\n\nHPI: Jane M. Doe is a 59 y.o. female here for follow-up of her NSCLC prior to treatment with Keytruda q21-days. On 2020-12-10, the patient met with Dr. and was recommended maintenance pembrolizumab and advised against consolidative radiation. We reviewed her CT scans and brain MRI done here together and compared them with multiple prior scans. I am pleased to see that she has had a good response to therapy. However, she did have metastatic disease at diagnosis. Therefore, while there has been a response to treatment, I still favor a prolonged treatment response before any definitive therapy is considered. In my opinion, she can resume maintenance pembrolizumab locally and continue restaging scans every 3 months. She may still be a candidate for consolidative therapy down the road after several cycles.\n\n2021-02-08: Patient's labs are stable. TSH: 1.09. Continued treatment with Keytruda on 2021-02-09.  \n2021-02-15: CT chest without contrast impression:  \n1. Lingular mass now measured at 3.6 x 2.5 cm as opposed to 2.7 x 2.4 cm previously.  \n2. Left hilar lymphadenopathy somewhat improved. No new adenopathy evident.  \n3. No new pulmonary nodule. Previously demonstrated 5 mm right lower lobe nodule no longer evident. 7 x 6 mm left lower lobe nodule now measured at 10 x 4 mm.  \n4. Coronary artery disease.  \n2021-03-01: TSH low at 0.041, free T4 WNL at 1.54. Decreased levothyroxine dose to 75 mcg. Patient c/o dysphagia.  \n2021-03-22: Patient scheduled for repeat PET scan. Will plan to give Keytruda after the PET scan.\n\nOncologic history:  \n2020-03-07: PET/CT hypermetabolic lingular mass approx 3.4 x 3.8 cm with numerous mediastinal nodes, 8 mm pulmonary nodule in the right lung base, and metastatic left supraclavicular node.  \n2020-03-30: Bronchoscopy with EBUS-guided FNA. Pathology diagnosis/interpretation:  \nA. Lymph node, 7, EBUS guided fine needle aspiration -- metastatic non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.  \nB. Lymph node, 4R, EBUS guided fine needle aspiration -- metastatic non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.  \nC. Lung, left lingula, transbronchial fine needle aspiration -- non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.  \nD. Lung, left lower lobe, bronchoalveolar lavage -- non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.  \n2020-08-03: Patient underwent PET/CT which demonstrated:  \n1. Findings are consistent with a partial response to treatment with overall improving PET-CT when compared to the prior study.  \n2. Significant decrease in size and metabolic activity within mediastinal and left hilar lymph nodes. Residual hypermetabolic activity is noted consistent with some residual viable tumor.  \n3. Decreasing size and metabolic activity within the primary lesion in the posterior lingula on the left. The previous small ground-glass nodule anteriorly within the left upper lobe has resolved.  \n4. No suspicious findings for metastatic disease to the abdomen or pelvis.  \n2020-10-14: B/L LE U/S neg for DVT. TSH declined to 23.  \n2020-10-22: PET:  \nHead and neck: The paired glandular structures and muscles of the neck are symmetrical.

Doe is a 59-year-old female presenting for evaluation of:  \n1. NSCLC involving left lung, T4 N3 M1a (IVA).  \n- 2020-03-07 PET/CT demonstrated hypermetabolic lingular mass 3.4 x 3.8 cm with hypermetabolic mediastinal nodes, hypermetabolic 8 mm pulmonary nodule in the right lung base, and metastatic left supraclavicular node.  \n- 2020-03-30 bronchoscopy with EBUS-guided FNA. Pathology report from lymph nodes level 4R, 7, biopsy of LLL and BAL from LLL demonstrated adenocarcinoma.  \n- Patient was started on weekly carboplatin/taxol by Dr. Peterson with the thought that patient was going to receive definitive concurrent radiation. She received 5 weekly treatments with carboplatin/taxol with response on CT. She was determined by radiation oncology not to be a candidate for definitive chemoradiation due to the presence of a contralateral metastatic pulmonary nodule.  \n- She was recommended by Dr. Peterson to switch to carboplatin/taxol/keytruda every 3 week regimen and based on response could be considered for consolidative radiation. She has received 6 cycles completed 2020-09-24.  \n- PET/CT results from 2020-08-09 reviewed demonstrating partial response to treatment.  \n- 2020-08-10 NGS returned showing KRAS p.G12C mutation. PD-L1 neg.  \n- 2020-10-22 PET/CT showed a partial response to treatment.  \n- Referred back to Dr. Kiran of RadOnc for consideration of consolidation radiation. Order placed for patient to clinic for second opinion. I would like a recommendation regarding possible maintenance systemic treatment.  \n- 2020-12-10: Patient recently met with Dr. and was recommended maintenance pembrolizumab and he recommended against consolidative radiation. Recommended re-imaging every 3 months.  \n- 2021-02-09: Pembro continued.  \n- 12/31 CT chest impression:  \n1. Lingular mass now measured at 3.6 x 2.5 cm as opposed to 2.7 x 2.4 cm previously.  \n2. Left hilar lymphadenopathy somewhat improved. No new adenopathy evident.  \n3. No new pulmonary nodule. Previously demonstrated 5 mm right lower lobe nodule no longer evident. 7 x 6 mm left lower lobe nodule now measured at 10 x 4 mm.  \n4. Coronary artery disease.  \n- Patient due for treatment on 2021-03-21 with Keytruda, but rescheduled to 2021-03-22 after the PET scan. Disease appears to be slowly progressing. Will assess with PET/CT scheduled on 2021-03-22. XRT and/or KRAS directed treatment will be considered. Have patient follow up with Dr. Ravih. Patient is going to call and schedule an appointment.  \n2. Hypothyroidism - TSH has been fluctuating, most recently low at 0.041. Today's result is pending. Dose of levothyroxine decreased to 75 mcg on 2021-03-01. Monitor TSH, free T4.  \n3. Dysphagia. Refer to Dr. Youn for consideration of EGD. Completed on 2021-03-11.  \n4. Coronary artery disease. Seen on CT. Consult placed to cardiology for further evaluation. Consult completed on 2021-03-12. Patient scheduled for a PET/CT MPI with MFR to rule out significant CAD on 2021-04-27. If evaluation is stable, follow-up recommendation was 1 year.\n\n40 minutes spent in non-face-to-face clinical staff time with patient including coordinating care, chart review, and documentation.\n\nAva Walker, NP  \n2021-03-20 11:20:00",

Doe  \nAge: 59 y.o.  \nMedical record number: 0001024407  \nPrimary provider: Olivia Davis, PA  \n\nReason for visit: Patient with non-small cell lung cancer, likely stage IV disease.\n\nHPI: Jane M. Doe is a 59-year-old woman who presented in early December with increased chest heaviness and chest pain. A CT scan was performed to evaluate for pulmonary embolus, which was negative, but revealed a moderate large area of consolidation in the inferior lingula of the left lung, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, including a calcified granuloma in the right middle lobe, and mediastinal and left hilar adenopathy. A repeat CT scan on 2020-02-21 showed the lingular mass was approximately the same size, with a new 8 mm nodule by the aorta and a slightly increased nodule by the right diaphragm. A PET scan on 2020-03-07 showed a left-sided supraclavicular lymph node (5 mm, SUV 3.6), a hypermetabolic lingular mass (3.4 x 3.8 cm, SUV 18.4), and a hypermetabolic pulmonary nodule in the right lung base (8 mm, SUV 3.7). Numerous hypermetabolic mediastinal lymph nodes were also noted, including a subcarinal lymph node (1.4 cm, SUV 11.0). The patient was seen by pulmonary on 2020-03-10, and an EBUS showed positive lymph nodes involving 74R and the left lingula, consistent with adenocarcinoma. Further testing is pending. The patient continues to experience pleuritic pain, likely due to pleural invasion. Given the last CT scan was on 2020-01-04, a repeat CT scan with contrast is recommended to reevaluate the lymph nodes and nodules before starting treatment. The patient appears to have stage IV disease, making treatment decisions challenging. Radiation and chemotherapy are not typically indicated for stage IV disease, but a consultation with radiation therapy may be beneficial if there is a response to systemic treatment.\n\nAllergies: No known allergies\n\nPast Medical History: \n- Insomnia, unspecified (G47.00)\n- Mixed hyperlipidemia (E78.2)\n- Lumbar radiculitis (M54.16)\n\nCurrent Medications:\n- Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) 10 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet (10 mg) by mouth 3 times daily if needed for muscle spasm. 30 tablets, 1 refill.\n- Diclofenac topical (Voltaren) 1% gel: Apply 4 g topically to affected area(s) four times daily. 100 g, 0 refills.\n- Ibuprofen (Advil; Motrin) 800 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet (800 mg) by mouth every 8 hours if needed for pain. 100 tablets, 3 refills.\n- Ondansetron (Zofran) 8 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet (8 mg) by mouth every 8 hours if needed for nausea/vomiting. 30 tablets, 1 refill.\n- Pravastatin (Pravachol) 40 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet by mouth at bedtime. 90 tablets, 1 refill.\n- Pregabalin (Lyrica) 75 mg capsule: Take 2 capsules by mouth at bedtime. 180 capsules, 1 refill.\n- Prochlorperazine (Compazine) 10 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet (10 mg) by mouth every 8 hours if needed for nausea/vomiting. 30 tablets, 1 refill.\n- Trazodone (Desyrel) 100 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet (100 mg) by mouth at bedtime if needed for sleep. 90 tablets, 3 refills.\n\nNo current facility-administered medications for this visit.

The PET scan shows a hypermetabolic lingular mass invading the pleura, a small nodule in the left lung, and a hypermetabolic nodule in the right lung base. The patient also has a positive supraclavicular lymph node. Given the stage IV disease, the treatment plan will focus on systemic therapy. The plan is to start the patient on systemic chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, followed by immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. Radiation therapy will be considered for palliative purposes if needed. The patient will be referred to radiation oncology for further evaluation. We had a detailed discussion about the treatment options and the prognosis. The patient will receive 2 cycles of chemotherapy every 3 weeks, followed by maintenance pembrolizumab. No evidence of metastatic disease outside the chest was found. The patient will be closely monitored, and further imaging will be done to assess the response to treatment.\n\nYour cancer nurse navigator, Michael Harrison, RN, is available for any questions or concerns at 320.225.3.\n\nTotal time preparing to see this patient, face-to-face time, and coordinating care time on the same calendar date: 63 minutes.\n\nRonald Bastianson, MD  \nMedical Oncologist, Hematologist  \nHealth",

This now measures 2.4 x 2 cm compared with 3.5 x 3.8 cm previously. Suv max is 10.3 compared with 17.6 previously. Previous small ground glass nodule anteriorly within the left upper lobe is no longer identified. No new areas uptake are noted within the lungs. The chest wall and axilla demonstrates no significant abnormal uptake. The neck demonstrates no significant abnormal uptake with symmetric salivary and oropharyngeal activity. Liver and spleen demonstrate no significant abnormal uptake. Patient is status post cholecystectomy. Increased gastric activity is identified which is likely physiologic. The pancreas and bilateral adrenal glands demonstrate no abnormal uptake. Retrocrural region and retroperitoneum demonstrate no significant abnormal uptake. Iliac nodal chain and groin demonstrate no significant abnormal uptake. There is moderate to prominent diffuse marrow activity consistent with underlying systemic therapy. No focal skeletal lesion is seen. Impression: 1. Findings are consistent with a partial response to treatment with overall improving pet-ct when compared to the prior study. 2. Significant decrease in size and metabolic activity within mediastinal and left hilar lymph nodes. Residual hypermetabolic activity is noted consistent with some residual viable tumor. 3. Decreasing size and metabolic activity within the primary lesion in the posterior lingula on the left. The previous small ground-glass nodule anteriorly within the left upper lobe has resolved. 4. No suspicious findings for metastatic disease to the abdomen or pelvis. Dictated by david martinez, md @ 2020-08-04 14:12:18 (electronically signed)",

  "text": "Date of service: 2021-03-11 surgeon: owen youn, md preoperative diagnosis: dysphagia postoperative diagnoses: esophageal stricture procedure: egd with biopsy and dilation anesthesia: propofol specimens sent: duodenum gastric antrum indications: patient is a 59-year-old woman who presents for diagnostic egd. She has been having dysphagia mainly solids over liquids for the past 3 months, in the setting of nsclc of lingula. The nature reasons risks and possible complications of the procedure were explained to her and she stated she understood and wished to proceed. Details of procedure: patient brought into the endoscopy suite and placed in the left lateral decubitus position whereupon o2 sat monitor blood pressure cuff and ekg leads were placed. Cardiopulmonary status was normal pre-and postprocedure and monitored throughout. A time-out was then performed and the patient's identity along with the procedure to be performed was agreed upon by the surgical team. Iv sedation was administered. A bite block was inserted into the patient's mouth. A video endoscope was then passed through the bite block and carefully guided down the esophagus. The vocal cords and arytenoid cartilages were visualized and noted to be normal. The gastroesophageal junction was noted to be at approximately 36 cm from the incisors. The z line appeared regular, but there was a tight stricture with narrowing at the ge junction from chronic fibrosis, consistent with shatzki's ring. A picture of this was taken. The scope was then advanced into the stomach and no gastritis or gastropathy was found in the antral area. Pictures of this was taken. The pylorus was then intubated and the scope was passed into the duodenum up to its third portion. There were no significant abnormalities noted here. Cold biopsies were taken from the first portion of the duodenum. The scope was then brought back into the stomach and cold biopsies were taken from the antral area and sent for pathology and helicobacter pylori analysis. The scope was then retroflexed and no hiatal hernia was noted. This was also photo documented. The hill grade of the gastroesophageal valve revealed to be 2. Dilation was done with balloon, up to 15 mm across. The ge junction where stricture was present. This was done for 2 minutes, and no complications were noted afterwards. The scope was then withdrawn up the length of the esophagus and removed. The bite block was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in a stable condition. Will call with pathology results if anything abnormal. Owen youn, md general surgery",
